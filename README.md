# Command Pattern

### About
In these repositories, some design patterns are implemented to a mini game system for self education. They may not be suited to use in an actual game (directly anyway). However, it is good to have some examples underhand to take reference. And even if anyone wants to use them, you are welcome.

### Definition
Command pattern, encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
